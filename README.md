# Surfing Game
School Project
  inspired by Bogan Surfer
    some artwork was taken from there (the waves for the first level - no changes were made for them --> the colour scheme was altered for the other levels)

    to add to the online server do this:
      open cmd
      write: cd "C:\Users\Administrator\OneDrive\Computing\Final Project\Computing-Project"
      write: git push heroku master
    To sync changes to files of JS with server:
      sync with git
      in cmd write: git push heroku master
